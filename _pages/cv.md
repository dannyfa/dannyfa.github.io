Research Experience
======
* Fall 2019 - present: Brains & Computation Lab
  * Duke University 
  * <strong> Summary: </strong> Research focus is on developing novel statistical machine learning techniques and in 
  applying these to provide more flexible and reliable modeling and analysis methods 
  for neuroscience data broadly (e.g., fMRI, EEG, ECoG).
  * PI: John Pearson
  
* Fall 2015 - Summer 2017: Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch (CTNB)
  * National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
  * <strong> Summary: </strong> Main project involved combining genome-wide association analysis and neuroimaging methodologies in 
  an agnostic, high-throughput voxel-wise and genome-wide approach to investigate genetic determinants of 
  working memory function. 
  * PIs: Karen Berman & Joseph Callicott 

* Spring 2013 - Spring 2015: Woldorff Laboratory
  * Duke University 
  * <strong> Summary: </strong> Main project involved leveraging the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) 
  and a previously validated translational sustained attention paradigm to investigate the effects of a visual, 
  global distractor on the temporal cascade of electrical brain processes associated with ongoing sustained 
  attention efforts. 
  * PI: Marty Woldorff 
  
Skills
======
* <strong> Programming </strong> 
    * Pytorch, Python, C, C++, SQL, R, Julia, Latex
* <strong> Spoken Languages </strong>
    * English (fluent), Portuguese (native), Spanish (advanced)
* <strong> Biomedical Data Analysis </strong>
   * Electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis (EPR and time-frequency methods)
   * Neuroimaging (fMRI, DTI, MR spectrostcopy) data analysis (SPM, FSL, Afni, NiBabel, Pydicom, Nilearn)
   * Genomics Data Analysis

Service and leadership
======
* Creative Computing Educational Program 
  * Role: Co-Founder, Instructor
  * Active Time: Spring 2023 - present
  * Description: This program is aimed at teaching 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> graders 
  about basic principles of computer programming logic using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about), 
  a free, high-level programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab for educational purposes.

* Boost Beyond Program (Duke University School of Medicine)
  * Role: Mentor
  * Active Time: Spring 2021 - Fall 2023
  * Description: This program is aimed at mentoring and supporting high-school students from minority 
  or under-privileged backgrounds interested in pursuing careers in STEM throughout their college 
  application process. 

* Hand2Hold Student Group (Duke University School of Medicine)
  * Role: Executive Board Member; Educator 
  * Active Time: Fall 2017 - Fall 2018 
  * Description: This is a student group at the Duke SOM with two main goals: 1) prototyping
  and constructing customized "wearables" for low-income patients with small hand and/or finger 
  amputations; 2) providing educational outreach to minority students interested in STEM (through 
  Duke's Boost Program) by introducing these students to basics of hand anatomy, 3D printing, and
  engineering design.

* NIMH's Schizophrenia Ward Clinical Program 
  * Role: Volunteer
  * Active Time: Fall 2015 - Summer 2017
  * Description: This program is aimed at helping researchers at NIMH gain direct experience working 
  with schizophrenia patients, the clinical teams, and patient families, at NIMH's adult inpatient 
  psychiatric unit.
