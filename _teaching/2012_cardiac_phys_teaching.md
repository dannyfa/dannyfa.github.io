I was a teaching assistant for the graduate cardiac physiology course at University of Brasilia's School of Medicine (Brazil). 

<strong>Duties:</strong> explained, demonstrated, and supervised the conduction of practical laboratory work in cardiac physiology to 
accompany the topics covered in the theoretical portion of the medical cardiac physiology course. All second year medical students
are required to take this course as part of their core medical science requirements.
