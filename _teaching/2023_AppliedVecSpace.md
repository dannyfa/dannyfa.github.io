This is a graduate course introducing incoming ECE masters and PhD students to fundamental concepts 
in logic and set theory, metric spaces, topology, vector spaces, and convex optimization. For additional 
details see course website [here](http://pfister.ee.duke.edu/courses/ece586/). For my work as a TA for this course, 
I was selected to receive Duke ECE's outstanding graduate student TA award  on Spring 2024! 

<strong>Duties:</strong> Held office hours, discussion, and review sessions to help students with questions on 
coursework material, homework, or projects. Helped grading homework, quizzes, midterms and final projects. Proposed new 
questions for homework and quizzes.
