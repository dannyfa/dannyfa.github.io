I was a teaching assistant for Physics 141L (Classical Mechanics) and 142L (E&M) for life
science undergraduate students at Duke during the summer of 2015. These courses were taught 
during Summer Sessions I, II and were conducted at Duke's marine laboratory campus in Beaufort, NC. 

<strong>Duties:</strong> Provided small lectures and formal proofs of theorems for students, held office hours 
to support students with questions on homework and class activities, helped students with in-class problems,
 administered and corrected weekly quizzes, laboratory reports, and exams and organized laboratory sessions.
