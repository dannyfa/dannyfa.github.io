This is a graduate course on probabilistic machine learning methods cross-listed between ECE, Statistics, 
and Computer Science (CS). It covers key concepts in prediction and decision making typically encountered in 
machine learning and data science, under a more formal statistical viewpoint. For additional details, see course 
website [here](https://ericlaber.github.io/). For my work as a TA for this course, I was selected to receive Duke ECE's 
outstanding graduate student TA award on Spring 2023! 

<strong>Duties:</strong> Held office hours, discussion, and review sessions to help students with questions on 
coursework material, homework, or projects. Helped grading homework and quizzes. Created new material for 
discussion sessions and homework.
